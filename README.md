# Hi there 👋

My name is Michael R. Bock. I'm a software engineer living and working in California.

I'm generally interested in technology, software architecture, scaling software organizations, startups, politics, autonomous vehicles, and cities.

I'm the co-founder & CTO of [Column Tax](https://time.com/7094552/column-tax/). We're working on making the tax system in this country fundamentally more-fair. And we're solving some incredibly complex software problems to get there. So far, things are working: we have a real shot at changing this industry that hasn't changed in quite a long time and building a massive business while we do it. If you're interested in working with a group of incredibly-smart humans on interesting problems, we're [hiring](https://jobs.columntax.com/).

I read and respond to every personal message I get. To get in touch, [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelrbock).

  talk about this project on
  [this podcast](https://podcast.matsherman.com/332-michel-bock-selfdrivingfyi-on-all-things-self-driving-cars/).
* [TopTweets.by](https://toptweets.by/): go to TopTweets.by/@username to easily see someone’s popular tweets.

* [Sesh](http://getsesh.io):
  a way for engineers and designers to train more like athletes.

  actually aligns with our long-term goals.
* [Detailed notes](https://github.com/michaelrbock/notes/tree/master/books/designing-data-intensive-applications)
  on the book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)
  and an associated [Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/648324831).
* [CarCraft](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/):
  Waymo's simulated world for testing self-driving cars.
* [Some](https://pioneer.app/blog/pioneer-multiplayer/)
  [things](https://pioneer.app/blog/advisor-chat/) [I launched](https://pioneer.app/blog/the-infinite-tournament/)

* The [Edmunds.com API](https://github.com/EdmundsAPI) and associated wrappers.

I also (very) ocassionally angel invest (mostly in friends' companies who I want to support and follow along with). I can sometimes be helpful to other founders in the very early idea maze and with thinking through hiring strategy (especially hiring a first Head of Engineering). So far, I've invested in:

* [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/HpHf)
* [Pulley](https://www.withpulley.com/)
* [Agent](https://www.agent.tax/)
* [Taxwire](https://www.taxwire.com/)
