# What I'm doing now

This is [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

I'm working on a few projects in the productivity software space:

* [Sesh](http://getsesh.io): a way for engineers and designers to train more like athletes.
* [Sludge](http://sludge.life): an app to reclaim the time we spend on social media and ensure that time
  actually aligns with our long-term goals.
* A yet-unannounced project.

For my current employment status, check my LinkedIn.
