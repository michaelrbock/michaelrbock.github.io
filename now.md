# What I'm doing now

This is a [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

I'm the co-founder & CTO of [Column Tax](https://www.columntax.com/). We're
working on making the tax system in this country fundamentally more-fair. And
we're solving some incredibly complex software problems to get there. So far,
things are working: we have a real shot at changing this industry that hasn't 
changed in quite a long time and building a massive business while we do it. If
you're interested in working with a group of incredibly-smart humans on
interesting problems, we're [hiring](https://jobs.columntax.com/). Get in touch:
DM or email me.
