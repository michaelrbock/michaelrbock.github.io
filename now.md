# What I'm doing now

This is a [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

I'm working on a few projects, mostly in the productivity software space:

* [Sesh](http://getsesh.io): a way for engineers and designers to train more like athletes.
* [Sludge](http://www.sludge.life): an app to reclaim the time we spend on social media and ensure that time
  actually aligns with our long-term goals.
* A [yet-unannounced project](https://lifedom.io).
* [SelfDriving.fyi](https://selfdriving.fyi/): a comprehensive list of every company working on autonomous vehicles.
* I just launched [TopTweets.by](https://toptweets.by/), a site quickly find a user's most popular tweets.
